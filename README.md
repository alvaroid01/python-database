# python-database
This repository will contain all the information regarding the research,design and implementation of a database created from scratch in Python

## Why building my own database from scratch?
As a software engineer I like to understand how things work and behave, be it a website, a server, a backend framework, or in this case, a DBMS (Database Management System).
Of course I could just read about it but that wouldn't allow me to get a full picture of everything that happens when I hit a database with a request.
How is connection between the server and databse stablished?
How does the database know what request to process first?
What algorithms are used to read and write data in the blink of an eye?
How is the data really structured and in what format?

All this questions can only be fully understood by building it myself and struggle with all the little details that make a database work

## Technology
The language I decided to write the DBMS in is Python. While I could try writting it on C or Rust, that would only open yet another can of worms to be digested as I know nothing about low level programming. 
My main focus is roughly understanding the principles and mechanisms that make a database a database. I don't care about the language, I care about the inner patterns and algorithms used.
Python is not my main language but by building this I will certainly get better at it.
